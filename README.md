# worker
This R package builds a funds flow based on contract details and then solves for the seed capital needed to meet cash flow requirements. The primary use case is to design a workers' compensation self-insurance fund.

You can install this package by executing this code into the R console

```
devtools::install_github( "wgfoote/worker" )

```
Enter `??fund_flow` or `??fund_capital` in the R console to get information on how to run the two functions in the package and experiment with examples of code using the functions.
