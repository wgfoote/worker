Description: Suppose we want to self-insure workers' compensation claims in our organization. This function helps an analyst to build a matrix rows of forward period unit cashflow with columns of funding contracts which specify forward rates, start and finish dates. Returned are the initial contract specification and the cashflow matrix.
    The analyst solves for the initial seed capital given contract specifications for capital across forward periods needed, all to match cashflow requirements in forward periods.
